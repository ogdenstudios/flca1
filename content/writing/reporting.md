Abstract
This
qualitative
analysis examines the
intersection
 of two separate sets of
policy
:
Mandated reporting of child abuse & neglect, and the state
-
level regulation of marijuana, or
cannabis. Through policies and laws
created to address
 the needs of infants who are born
exposed to controlled substances, substance
-
exposed newborn (SEN) initiatives provide the focal
point at which these two regimes come together. In Massachusetts, where marijuana use by
adults has been decriminalized and a
pproved for medicinal use, mandated reporting practices,
which require certain professionals to report instances of child abuse or neglect, have not been
updated to reflect these recent cannabis law reforms. This report is based on original qualitative
res
earch, assessing the gaps in implementation of marijuana reform as they relate to SEN policy,
mandated reporting practices, and procedures of the civil child welfare system (DCF) in the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts
.
