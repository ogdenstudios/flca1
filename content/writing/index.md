### Request for a speaker from FLCA to come talk to your conference, convention, rally, festival, school,  or other event

Our founders, Sara Arnold aka Sahra Kant and Jess Cochrane, are available individually or together for speaking engagement at your event by ourselves, in a workshop, on a panel, or any other format.  We appreciate as much notice as possible to ensure that we are able to attend your event.  Due to the cost of local or national travel and our organization being operated on a volunteer basis, please let us know if you are able to reimburse the cost of transport, lodging, or any other expenses.
