Among drug policy reform activists, there is a consensus that
punitive approaches should
not constitute the bulk of our national strategy to reduce the harms associated with addiction and
problematic use
 of drugs.
 Whether in recognition of its fiscal irresponsibility, its conflict with
public health goals, or its disparate impact on
 brown,
 black
,
 and
poor
 communities, we agree that
mass incarceration is not an appropriate solution to the problems caused b
y drugs themselves.
We recognize the incoherence of a zero
-
tolerance
, or “prohibitionist”
 approach to drug policy,
and the futility of repressive tactics premised upon the total elimination of drugs from society.
Unsurprisingly, many of us favor the decrim
inalization
—
replacement of criminal penalties with
civil sanctions
—
of
 some drug offenses
 that are currently prohibited. On the state level, we have
successfully lobbied to relax restrictions on cannabis use
in 14 states
and make it available for
medical u
se in
20
 states
 and the District of Columbia
.
1
We fought to
end
 the
sentencing
disparities between crack and powder cocaine
 (and have, at least, succeeded in reducing the
disparities)
,
2
 and
 continue to fight for sentencing reform, especially for nonviolent offenses. This
work is crucial and must continue.
At the same time, we must integrate into our
strategy
 an understanding that the criminal
law is far from the
only
 source of overreaching
prohibitionist approaches. Running parallel to it
are family courts and the civil child welfare system
, which have
be
come
a major mechanism for
enforcing prohibitionist policies in ways that are bot
h discriminatory and scientific
ally
unfounded. Actors with
in this system routinely
 treat testing positive for illegal drugs as the basis
for findings of child neglect and parental unfitness,
and
collaborate
 with law enforcement in the
criminal prosecution of pregnant women for child endangerment, drug delivery to
 a minor
, and
feticide. Child protective
 services (CPS) wields unbelievable power ov
er families
—
especially
poor families and families of color
—
and has the authority to remove a child from
his
 parent’s
custody, place
him
 in foster care or up for adoption, a
nd potentially terminate
the
 legal rights
of
the
 parent. CPS systems of reporting, investigation, and placement disproportionately regulate
the behavior of women, especially single mothers and those who are pregnant.
This regulation occurs not only through
 enforcement of the criminal law, but also through
state
-
administered CPS agencies, vested by authority under civil statute to protect vulnerable

2
children.
3
 Mandated reporting laws, which have required certain professionals to report known or
suspected child abuse or neglect, have in some states been expanded in recent years to include
exposure of a newborn to illegal drugs as grounds for a CPS report.
4
 Thoug
h health care
providers are often motivated to identify patients who use substances by concerns about the
clinical impact of maternal drug and alcohol abuse, mandated reporting laws force them to
implement surveillance of their patients and breach their tr
ust and privacy by informing the state
of their illicit activity when children are involved. This transforms doctors and nurses into state
investigators, who feel bound by the law to err on the side of over
-
reporting instances of parental
drug use (especia
lly drug use by pregnant women) even in the absence of any unique, much less
discernible, harm to a child.
The trend of expanding child abuse and neglect laws to cover pregnant women’s maternal
drug use during the prenatal period illustrates what some have
 called a “fetal
-
maternal conflict,”
wherein the liberty interests of the pregnant woman are allegedly at odds with the liberty
interests of the fetus. This is a false equivalency
—
first and foremost, the Supreme Court has held
firmly that fetuses are
not
 p
ersons under the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment
—
and in
truth, reflects a desire to enhance the state’s power over pregnant women. Those in favor of so
-
called “fetal personhood” have promoted using the “rights” of a fetus as a proxy to effectuate
state
 interests. As support for the concept of “personhood” has gained traction nationally, some
prosecutors, along with some CPS workers, have invoked the State’s obligation to protect
vulnerable children to frame fetus and mother as opposing parties in a bala
ncing of liberty
interests.
5
 In developing the argument that the State may control and punish a pregnant woman
for the alleged benefit of a fetus, a great deal of cases have involved the investigation and/or
prosecution of a woman who used illegal drugs at
 some point during pregnancy.
6
Indeed, the ugly caricatures that come to mind when the image of a pregnant drug user is
invoked are fueled simultaneously by the twin moral panics of drug abuse and child abuse, which
converged in the 1980s in the form of th
e “crack baby” myth. Though the claims of irreversible
brain damage which fed the media frenzy are now understood to have been scientifically
unfounded,
7
 the “crack baby” image retains its power in the American conscience and continues
to inform legal and
regulatory schemes on the national, state, and local levels. Through chemical
endangerment, feticide, and mandated reporting laws
—
particularly those designed to identify
“substance
-
exposed newborns” (“SENs”)
—
the prohibition of controlled substances collide
s with

heightened state scrutiny of families living in poverty to create a culture of surveillance and
policing of pregnant women and low
-
income parents. As the reform movement gains traction
within the states and nationally, advocates for liberalized drug
 laws must recognize the role
played by child welfare authorities
—
in conjunction with, as well as independently from, criminal
law enforcement
—
in carrying out the failed policies of the War on Drugs.
This
essay
 explores political, legal, and ethical issu
es at the intersection of the U.S. War
on Drugs, the politics of abortion access, and the administration of the modern welfare state. It
begins by reviewing the use of criminal prohibition to eliminate societal ills, drawing crucial
parallels between the p
rohibition of controlled substances and the criminalization of abortion.
Next, it traces the expansion of state child protection agencies and evidence of their
disproportionate intervention in the homes of low income, nonwhite families. SEN policies form
t
he focal point of the discussion as a prominent example of the entanglement of the War on
Drugs with regulation of reproduction and child welfare policy. In the final section, I promote
the intentional inclusion of reproductive justice in the work of drug
policy reform, in recognition
of both ethical and practical intersections of these movements.  
I.
PROHIBITION AND CRIMINALIZATION
Starting from the notion that government has a duty to protect its citizens through the
enforcement
 of
 the
 criminal
code
,
some
degree of regulation of individuals and industry is
necessary to carry out this responsibility. The strictest form of regulation is criminal prohibition:
the outright ban of a certain act or good
—
zero tolerance under the law (albeit not on the streets).
Ge
nerally, serious violent crimes, such as murder and assault, are accepted as morally repugnant
enough to fall within the prohibition of the criminal law. The influence of John Stuart Mill’s
harm principle on classic American liberalism provides easy justif
ication for prohibition of
conduct that directly causes harm to another individual. When a person’s act threatens the life,
liberty, or property of another person, it is widely accepted that government has the authority,
both legal and moral, to enforce th
e criminal law against the actor.
Beyond prohibiting conduct that harms another individual, the criminal law has more
controversially been employed to prohibit acts and items that are deemed morally harmful or
dangerous to society at large, such as sex wor
k and the use of certain substances. The debate
over whether conduct that does
not
 cause direct harm to another individual should be

during pregnancy, and most hospita
ls report a positive neonatal test result for any illegal drug
even when the baby is born completely healthy and discharged safely. One paradox of this
sequence is that by the time the baby is born, there is no possible further risk of harm due to drug
exp
osure, as the child is no longer in the mother’s womb. Mandated reporting of SENs therefore
cannot serve the preventive purpose of facilitating access to substance abuse treatment
during
pregnancy so that the newborn may
avoid
 being born “substance
-
exposed
.”

IV.
UNDERMINING DRUG POLICY REFORM THROUGH THE CPS SYSTEM
In advocating for liberalized drug laws, reformers and policymakers must consider the
unique position of pregnant and parenting adults, whose lives are regulate
d not only by the
criminal law
bu
t also by CPS agencies. For example,
Massachusetts is one of a growing number
of U.S. jurisdictions that has seen reforms of its marijuana laws, since voters decriminalized
petty possession for adults in 2008 and created a medical marijuana program in 2012
.
43
 Since
decriminalization, the onetime crime of simple marijuana possession has been reduced to the
status of a civil “violation,” now punishable only by a $100 fine and citation.
44
45
Though most
adults who possess marijuana for personal use are now subjec
t to minimal state scrutiny (simple
marijuana possession is no longer included in a CORI check, nor can it be used as a ba
sis for
denial of financial aid,
adoption
, or foster parenting
), parenting adults still face the possibility
that state child protective agencies will look unfavorably upon their use of marijuana and use it
to support a finding of child neglect or endangerment, threatening custody of their children.
Surveillance of
prenatal care patients and mandated SEN reporting laws through CAPTA
create a role conflict for obstetric care providers and pediatricians,
46
 who are legally required to
investigate and disclose
to the state use of illicit drugs by their patients or their p
atients’ parents
.
Instead of encouraging the diagnosis of substance abuse disorders or requiring expanded access
and referrals to treatment
 for drug users who are addicted
, CAPTA instead results in the over
-
reporting of drug use not accompanied by actual
h
arm
 to the child.
47
 The ideology of the War on
Drugs
—
that all use of illicit drugs is abuse
—
allows CPS agencies to avoid any inquiry into the
extent to which a parent’s drug use inhibits their ability to parent their child.
48
 Instead, a positive
drug test or
 admission of use can form the sole basis for a
n investigation, a finding of child abuse
or
neglect, or removal of a child from the home.

V.
LEAVING PROHIBITION IN THE PAST
As we move toward a model of legal regulation and away from criminal prohibition,
a
successful
 drug policy reform
 movement
must adapt its strategies to incorporate reform of
prohibitionist
civil law including
child welfare policy and practice. If a legal medical marijuana
patient can face CPS intervention on the basis of drug use alone,
we have not done enough to
ensure that the policy solutions we offer include full protection of
individual
 liberty. When use of
a substance is legal or decriminalized for adults, yet pregnant women and parents stand to
face
findings of child neglect or eve
n
lose custody of their chil
dren
 based solely on a positive drug
test result, we must ensure that this loophole is closed. Anticipating these issues, and planning
for integration of non
-
criminal state agencies in the implementation of reform law and policy
,
means engaging with
and supporting the work of
advocates for the autonomy of pregnant women
and parents
,
as well as
striving for
reproductive justice for all families.

 As Dorothy Roberts wrote, “...a positive toxicology (which may be false) reveals only that the mother ingested
drugs shortly before the delivery. It tells us nothing about the extent of the mother’s drug use, any harm to the
baby,
or the mother’s parenting abilities. Equating evidence of maternal drug use with child neglect circumvents the
inquiry into the mother’s competence to care for her child that is customarily necessary to deprive a parent of
custody. This could mean th
at separating a mother from her newborn based on occasional
—
or even a single instance
of
—
drug use.” (p. 160)
