> We offer this best-practice, gold standard model language for parent-protective provisions in progressive marijuana legislation and ballot initiatives. Current parent-protective provisions in state-level cannabis laws are do not provide the level of protection families deserve. Each word in FLCA’s model language has been chosen deliberately and carefully to fully protect parents from experiencing assessments, investigations, actions and proceedings by CPS or in family or juvenile court regarding child welfare or custodial matters. If you are drafting medical or recreational marijuana legislation, or a ballot initiative in your state, we are happy to assist in integrating this language to fit your bill’s specific format. Please contact us at info@flcalliance.org for our help, or to let us know that you are using our language. Thank you!
