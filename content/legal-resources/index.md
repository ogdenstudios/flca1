### Request for non-legal advice and legal referrals

We cannot help everyone who contacts us or assist with every case.  Non-legal advice and legal referrals is operated on a volunteer basis and we receive many more requests than we can feasibly help with in our time constraints.  We do not always have advice or referrals for every state beyond what exists on this website.  We will provide non-legal advice and legal referrals wherever possible.  Please allow one calendar week for a response; if you require assistance more urgently, please tell us and we will do our best to reply sooner.
